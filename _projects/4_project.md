### **Introduction**
In the heart of city life, the interactions among cars, pedestrians, and electric bikes (e-bikes) are a delicate dance with significant safety implications. We have explored the dynamics at right-turn-on-red (RTOR) intersections, where e-bikes play a dual role that complicates traffic interactions. These vehicles, while non-motorized, often assert themselves like motor vehicles, leading to disputes over right-of-way and raising traffic safety concerns.

### **Research Methodology**
This study utilizes the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) model, a nuanced approach that accounts for the uncertainties inherent in real-world decision-making. We selected three diverse intersections in Ningbo, China, and employed video recording and cutting-edge target recognition technology to dissect the behavior patterns of cars, pedestrians, and e-bikes at RTOR intersections.

### **Key Findings**
- Behavioral Insights: E-bikes tend to act more like motor vehicles than pedestrians when interacting with other road users, causing disorder and potential conflicts.
- Traffic Dynamics: The involvement of e-bikes disrupts the usual traffic flow, reducing efficiency and posing safety risks. Despite being classified as vulnerable, e-bikes often exhibit assertive behavior, challenging the established norms between cars and pedestrians.
- Policy Implications: The study recommends measures such as speed limits for e-bikes and the introduction of traffic regulations to guide their behavior, with the goal of improving traffic efficiency and safety.

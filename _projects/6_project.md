At first, let's take a look at a video to know the whole project!

In the wake of the full relaxation of pandemic control measures, numerous nucleic acid testing kiosks have become underutilized. This presents an opportunity to repurpose these facilities, thereby achieving a dual benefit of waste reduction and enhanced public convenience.


Utilizing the collected Point of Interest (POI) data, we conducted an analysis to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of diverse commercial establishments within the research area. Furthermore, the road vector data collected was employed to perform isochronous circle analyses for each neighborhood, thereby delineating the 15-minute life circle range. By overlaying the POI data with the 15-minute isochron circles of the neighborhoods, we enhanced our understanding of the distribution and quantity of business types within the residential reach of each community.

During the field research, we collected comprehensive data on the number and distribution of nucleic acid testing booths within the study area, along with their dimensions of length, width, and height. We also documented the features of doors and windows, the condition of equipment, and the relationship with the surrounding streets. Additionally, we conducted interviews with local residents to gather their basic information and to understand their expectations and opinions regarding the potential repurposing of these testing booths.

Based on the collected survey data and analysis, we have identified seven types of functional business formats suitable for the repurposing of nucleic acid testing booths. Additionally, taking into account the existing dimensions and basic conditions of the booths, we have designed three size options for each business format.

With the progress of the project, we have been limited by quarantine measures, and also witnessed the relax of quarantine policy. Fortunately, we gradually returned to our normal life. It is gratifying to see that there have been various practical cases of nucleic acid kiosk transformation, which will urge us to implement our program.

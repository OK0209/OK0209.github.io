In the digital wave of the 21st century, Artificial Intelligence technology is reshaping the face of urban planning and design at an unprecedented speed. This traditional field, historically deeply rooted in human creativity and professional knowledge, is now gradually integrating AI's intelligent analysis and automated generation capabilities.This paradigm shift prompts a series of questions: 

1.In the filed of urban planning, are the extant AI-driven methodologies sufficiently attuned to our cities' needs and developmental trajectories? How might we refine these algorithms to enhance their realism and dependability? 

2.In the realm of urban design, where AIGC technologies are more evolved and adept at generating detailed urban scene visuals from textual and pictorial prompts, how can designers strategically use AI tools to serve as an enabling technology rather than a substitute for their creative endeavors?

To explore the two questions mentioned above, I have conducted research in the fields of urban planning and urban design respectively.

This study is committed to developing a multi-objective optimization model based on deep reinforcement learning and combining classical geographical theories to explore new methods of land use planning.

Research Progress: Data and expert knowledge collection is complete, and model construction is in progress.

Advanced AIGC technology, with tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney for media creation such as text-to-image, has enhanced designer productivity and lowered barriers for public participation in urban design, inevitably impacting the role of designers. 
This study explores the potential of AIGC to replace designers and how they can collaborate with AI tools in public engagement by using deep learning for scene generation, specifically modifying street corner garden scenes with Stable Diffusion. It analyzes AIGC outputs at different levels of design intervention to assess public satisfaction and adherence to the generated plans, guiding future collaboration between designers and AIGC.

This experiment examines AI-human designer collaboration by varying user image modification choices and prompt word freedom. It assesses user scores on aesthetics and conformity at different freedom levels, analyzing optimal designer involvement with AIGC in public design. The experiment is expected to recruit 160 participants.

Research Progress: The experiment with 160 participants has been completed, and data analysis is underway.

At first, let's take a look at a video to know the whole project!

With the full liberalization of epidemic prevention and control, a large number of nucleic acid kiosks are idle. Can we transform idle nucleic acid kiosks to realize the win-win situation of waste utilization and convenience?

   Partial analysis process
  
</div>
Using the collected POI data to analyze the number and distribution of various business types in the study area; The collected road vector data is used to carry out isochronous circle analysis of each community in the region to obtain the 15-minute life circle range. The POI data and the 15-minute isochron circle of the community were superimposed to better understand the distribution and quantity of business forms within the living circle of each community, and the required business forms and functions were judged from the perspective of data analysis.

    Content of field survey and questionnaire
</div>

The size, location, characteristics of doors and Windows, materials, and conditions of surrounding streets of nucleic acid sites in the study area were investigated, and the users were interviewed based on the data analysis results. Combined with the superimposed analysis results of 15-minute isotropic circle and POI in the residential area, functional business types were locked.

According to the size of nucleic acid sites investigated, we divided them into three sizes: large, medium and small, and designed the layout of furniture, electrical appliances, cabinets, etc.

With the progress of the project, we have been limited by quarantine measures, and also witnessed the relax of quarantine policy. Fortunately, we gradually returned to our normal life. It is gratifying to see that there have been various practical cases of nucleic acid kiosk transformation, which will urge us to implement our program.

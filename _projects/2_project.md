### **Introduction**
Balancing human development with conservation efforts is a global challenge. This project introduces a study conducted in the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China, which employs simulations of **Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS)** to assess the effectiveness of two ecological conservation programs: **Grain-to-Green (G2G) and Firewood-to-Electricity (F2E)**, in protecting the habitat of the giant panda through cost-effectiveness analysis.

By leveraging the **Socio-Econ-Ecosystem Multipurpose Simulator (SEEMS)**, an agent-based model designed for CHANS, this research offers a framework for policymakers to design economically viable and environmentally sustainable policies. It identifies optimal policy combinations that strike a balance between ecological conservation and economic growth, demonstrating the potential to achieve these dual goals within the constraints of limited budgets and the complexities of CHANS.

### **Research Focus**
This study employs the **Socio-Econ-Ecosystem Multipurpose Simulator (SEEMS)**, an agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate small-scale coupled human and nature systems. The research analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the G2G and F2E programs in terms of financial budget, habitat conservation performance, and local economic impacts.

### **Key Findings**
The study reveals that the **G2G program** achieves optimal financial efficiency at around **500 CNY/Mu**, with diminishing returns beyond **1000 CNY/Mu**. For the **F2E program**, a significant increase in electricity consumption and policy costs is observed when the subsidized electricity price drops below **0.3 CNY/kWh**. Comprehensive cost-efficiency analysis shows no significant correlation between financial burden and carbon emissions, but a positive association with habitat quality and a nonlinear relationship with total economic income. Pareto analysis identifies **18 optimal policy combinations** that balance carbon footprint, habitat quality, and financial benefits.
